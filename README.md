# Tutorial
This is me trying to setup a basic flask app and get up and running with flask. 

# Run the application
You can run this application using:
`flask --app flaskr init-db`
and then:
`flask --app flaskr run --debug`

Various notes I took on Flask are in the docs section. They can be seen here:

- [Setting up db](./docs/db)
- [What are flask blueprints](./docs/blueprint.md)
- [static files in flask](./docs/static.md)
